# Mobile-Application-Development
VTU 6th Semester - Mobile Application Development Lab programs (in Java)

All the lab programs have been added.

In case there is a commented code, that code will also work (when uncommented) and used properly.
That commented code is another approach to make that code work.

In case of XML parsing program, if the program doesn't work, change the value of index to 1.
In some cases it works for 0 but 1 for other cases.
